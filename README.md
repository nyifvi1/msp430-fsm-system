# MSP430 FSM-Based Embedded System

This project implements a **multi-mode embedded system** on the MSP430G2553 microcontroller. The system is interrupt-driven and uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to switch between three operational modes: frequency counter, stopwatch, and PWM-controlled buzzer.

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Mode 1: Frequency Counter (PB0)
- Measures input signal frequency using **Timer_A1 Input Capture**.
- Displays frequency in Hz on **LCD** in the range of 50Hzâ€“20kHz.
- LCD updates only the value digits to reduce flicker.

### âœ… Mode 2: Stopwatch (PB1)
- Implements a stopwatch using **Timer_A0 in Up/Down mode**.
- Activated by switch **SW0** and displays MM:SS format.
- Time resets after 59:59, display updates dynamically.

### âœ… Mode 3: PWM Buzzer (PB2)
- Samples analog voltage from **A3 input (potentiometer)** using ADC10.
- Translates ADC value to output frequency (1kHzâ€“2.5kHz).
- PWM signal generated on **P2.2** to control a buzzer.

## ðŸ§­ State Machine (FSM)

The system starts in `State 0` (idle), and transitions are based on pushbutton inputs:

- PB0 â†’ State 1 (Frequency Counter)
- PB1 â†’ State 2 (Stopwatch)
- PB2 â†’ State 3 (PWM Buzzer)

From States 1â€“3, the following transitions apply:

- PB0 â†’ Frequency Counter  
- PB1 â†’ Stopwatch  
- PB2 â†’ PWM Buzzer
